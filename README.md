## Dan Pelensky

I am currently undertaking the Makers Academy programming course, a highly selective immersive program to learn programming from a base level. I am a Canadian-Australian citizen with two Bachelor of Health Science degrees and six years of public service experience. At the age of 31 I quit my job, moved to London to learn to program. I am looking for an environment where I can be as immersed as Makers Academy, and learn something new every day.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have strong experience in varied written and verbal communications, including briefings, correspondence and memoranda.

- I have written professional communications for audiences from the general public to Government Minister, ensuring all communication was efficient, prompt, complete and accurate, to ensure understanding and retention of content.
- I maintained a public-facing website for Public Transport Victoria (PTV).
- I have a background in public speaking and technical training.

#### Stakeholder Management
I have significant experience in negotiation and proactive relationship management with internal and external stakeholders to maintain a positive, productive and mutually beneficial working relationship.
