I am a developer who trained at Makers Academy, a highly selective immersive program to learn to code, where I have had the time of my life learning something I love. I have kept a blog of my journey learning to code, you can see it [on Medium](http://www.medium.com/@pelensky).

I am a Canadian-Australian dual-citizen with the right to work in the UK. I have two Bachelor of Health Science degrees and six years of public service experience. At the age of 31 I quit my job and moved to London to become a developer. I am looking for a working environment where I can continue to learn as intensely as I have at Makers Academy.

#### Communication

I pride myself in my communication abilities. I have demonstrated experience in varied written and verbal communications, and am not afraid to have difficult conversations.

- I have written professional communications for audiences from the general public to Government Ministers, ensuring all communication was efficient, prompt, complete and accurate to ensure understanding and retention of content.
- I maintained a public-facing website for Public Transport Victoria (PTV).
- I have a background in public speaking and technical training.

#### Stakeholder Management
I have significant experience in negotiation and proactive relationship management with internal and external stakeholders. My goal has always been to maintain a positive, productive and mutually beneficial working relationship with my stakeholders.

- I managed the relationship between the office of the Minister for Small Business, Innovation and Trade and the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR) in Victoria. In this role every piece of communication between the Minister's Office and Department went through me.
- When Melbourne was changing ticketing systems, I managed the Metcard Fares and Ticketing Refund Policy which was administered by an external company.  In this role I provided oversight of OneLink Transit Systems’ application of the Metcard refund policy business rules, including the monitoring the performance of the OneLink Transit Systems refund department against Key Performance Indicators
